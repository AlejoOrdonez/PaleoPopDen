**Abstract**
Population dynamics set the framework for human genetic and cultural evolution. For foragers, demographic and environmental changes correlate strongly, although the causal relations between different environmental variables and human responses through time and space likely varied. Building on the notion of limiting factors, namely that the scarcest resource regulates population size, we present a statistical approach to identify the dominant climatic constraints for hunter-gatherer population densities and then hindcast their changing dynamics in Europe for the period between 20kyBP to 8kyBP. Limiting factors shifted from energy-related variables during the Pleistocene to a regional mosaic of limiting factors in the Holocene. This spatiotemporal variation suggests that hunter-gatherers needed to overcome very different adaptive challenges in different parts of Europe, and that these challenges vary over time. The signatures of these changing adaptations may be visible archaeologically. In addition, the spatial disaggregation of limiting factors from the Pleistocene to the Holocene coincides with and may partly explain the diversification of the cultural geography at this time.
