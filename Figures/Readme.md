Here you will find the code to make all the figures/tables in the paper
There are six(6) figures and one table.

**Figure 1.** Quantile Generalised Additive Models (qGAM) describing the relation between environmental factors and population density for 10-percentiles (purple lines), 50-percentiles (red lines), and 90-percentiles (blue lines). 

**Figure 2.** Convergence between current climatic conditions (hashed density plots) and paleoclimatic conditions at four different periods (coloured density plots). Paleoclimatic periods are Greenland Stadial 2, Greenland Interstadial 1, Greenland Stadial 1, and Holocene.

**Figure 3.** Estimates of climatically possible mean population density (top panel), and trends in key environmental variables (bottom). Estimated average population density for all Europe is based on the average of gird-based population densities (minimum predicted density for a cell) in Ice-Free regions (black line - top panel) based on the 50-percentile qGAMÂ¬. These estimates are compared to archaeological population proxy based on number of calibrated radiocarbon dates for Europe between 21 and 11kyBP based on 12 summaries of the Radiocarbon Palaeolithic Europe Database v28 93 (red- top panel), and core area (cf. 23 population density mean and upper/lower estimates based on the Cologne Protocol (blue- top panel). On the bottom panels, we show the changes in continental averages (mean across all ice free regions) of the environmental variables used to determine our population density estimate (minimum across all variables).

**Figure 4.** Estimated human population density across Europe for selected times during the 22ky to 8kyBP period. Areas in grey represent the glacier extent as derived by ICE-6G-C 92.

**Figure 5.** Factors limiting population density (F-J) across Europe for selected times during the 22ky to 8kyBP period. Areas in grey represent the glacier extent as derived by ICE-6G-C 92.

**Figure 6.** Proportion of the ice-free area of Europe where each variable was estimated to be the factor limiting population density (A); and estimated population size based on the mean environmental conditions for Europe (B). 

**Table 1.** Variables used to generate ethnographic based models of the effect of climate on hunter-gatherer population density and summary of cross-validated deviance explained for the evaluated variables. Estimates correspond to those of a 1000-fold cross-validation approach (1000 samples of 70% training and 30% testing observations) or the full dataset. The deviance explained in the context of a gaussian GAM represents the same as an unadjusted R2 on a linear regression context 85,86.
