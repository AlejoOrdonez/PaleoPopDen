# CODE
Here you will find for r scripts that generate:

1) the qGAM models for the 90th, 10th, and 560th Percentile **1. NatComs_ModelDevel.R**

2) Build a series of rasters with the predictors to be used **2. NatComs_PredBuild.R**

3) Predict population density for each env variable during the evaluated period **3. NatComs_PopDenPred.R**

4) Determine the minimum population density and the limiting factor **4. NatComs_MinPopDen-LimFact.R**
