1) Maps showing the spatial distribution of limiting factors as estimated based on gGAMs using 10- (`LimFact-10p_*.PDF`), 50-(`LimFact-50p_*.PDF`), and 90-percentiles (`LimFact-90p_*.PDF`). 

2) Bar plots Summarizing the proportion of the Ice free regions of Europe where each of the evaluated varibles was predicted to be the limiting factor. As the Maps, these estimates were done for qGAM model estimations based on sing 10- (`BarplotLimFact-10p.PDF`), 50-(`BarplotLimFact-50p.PDF`), and 90-percentiles (`BarplotLimFact-90p.PDF`).
