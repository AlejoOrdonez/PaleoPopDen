The Folder contains a series of  PDFs showing

1) Maps showing the spatial distribution of limiting factors as estimated based on gGAMs using 10- (`LimFact-10p_*.PDF`), 50-(`LimFact-50p_*.PDF`), and 90-percentiles (`LimFact-90p_*.PDF`). 

2) Bar plots Summarizing the proportion of the Ice free regions of Europe where each of the evaluated varibles was predicted to be the limiting factor. As the Maps, these estimates were done for qGAM model estimations based on sing 10- (`BarplotLimFact-10p.PDF`), 50-(`BarplotLimFact-50p.PDF`), and 90-percentiles (`BarplotLimFact-90p.PDF`). 

Evaluated variables are:
*ET*: Effective Temperature
*PET*: Potential Evaporation 
*NPP*: Net Primary Productivity - Estimated using the Miami Model
*MCM*: Minimum temperature of the Coldest Month
*MWM*: Maximum temperature of the Warmest Month
*TS*: Temperature Seasonality
*TAP*: Total Annual Precipitation
*PDM*: Precipitation of the Driest Month
*PWM*: Precipitation of the wettest Month
*PS*: Precipitation Sesonality
