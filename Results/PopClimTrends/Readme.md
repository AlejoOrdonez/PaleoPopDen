The folder shows the visualization of the predicted (based on 50-percentile qGAMS) and proxy trends in population density for all Europe as well as trends in evaluated environmental predictors. Plotted values represent the observed values in areas *NOT* covered by Ice at a the evaluated point in time.

*Fig 3* - shows the trends on pop-density+ proxies + env factors
*Fig 3_Ver2* - shows the trends on pop-density+ proxies + env factors+ avg estimated pop density from each predictor

the *AvgEnvPopDen* pdfs show the estimated population density estimates based on running the 10-, 50-, and 90- percentile qGAMS under the Avg Environmental conditions for Europe.

The evaluated variables are:
*ET*: Effective Temperature
*PET*: Potential Evaporation 
*NPP*: Net Primary Productivity - Estimated using the Miami Model
*MCM*: Minimum temperature of the Coldest Month
*MWM*: Maximum temperature of the Warmest Month
*TS*: Temperature Seasonality
*TAP*: Total Annual Precipitation
*PDM*: Precipitation of the Driest Month
*PWM*: Precipitation of the wettest Month
*PS*: Precipitation Seasonality
