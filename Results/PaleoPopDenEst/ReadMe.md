The folder contains a series of PDFs showing 

1) The predicted minimum population density for each period between 21kaBP and 8kaBPas as determined based on the 10- (`PaleoPopDenEst-10.PDF`), 50-(`PaleoPopDenEst-50.PDF`), and 90-percentiles (`PaleoPopDenEst-90.PDF`) gGAMs of the evaluated environmental variables.

1) The difference between the predicted population density based on each of the evaluated variables and the predicted minimum population density for each time period between 21kaBP and 8kaBPas based on 10- (`PaleoPopDenEst-10.PDF`), 50-(`PaleoPopDenEst-50.PDF`), and 90-percentiles (`PaleoPopDenEst-90.PDF`) gGAMs.

The evaluated variables are:
*ET*: Effective Temperature
*PET*: Potential Evaporation 
*NPP*: Net Primary Productivity - Estimated using the Miami Model
*MCM*: Minimum temperature of the Coldest Month
*MWM*: Maximum temperature of the Warmest Month
*TS*: Temperature Seasonality
*TAP*: Total Annual Precipitation
*PDM*: Precipitation of the Driest Month
*PWM*: Precipitation of the wettest Month
*PS*: Precipitation Sesonality
