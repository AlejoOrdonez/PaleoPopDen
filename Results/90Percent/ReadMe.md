The folder include three `.RData` files that have the predicted population density for each evaluated variable `PaleoPopDenEst10.RData`, the minimum populations density predicted for any given grid `MinPopPopDen10.RData`, and the environmental variable that predicted the lowest populations density `LimFact10.RData`. While predicted population density `.RData` files include the values for the full region, minimum populations density and Limiting factors `.RData` files mask-out all the areas where covered by Ice as defined by the ICE-6G gridded data product ^1^.
